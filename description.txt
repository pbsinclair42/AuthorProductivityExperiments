Project 2. Productivity of authors from network structure.

Some scientists (like Erdos) are very productive and write many articles. Can we find any relation between the productivity of authors and their position in the network?

In many types of networks, nodes that are more centrally located are seen to be more influential or important. For example, in economic networks, these are powerful entities, in the internet, these are the major ISPs controlling the internet backbones, etc. Does this pattern also hold among scientific authors? If so, what is the right measure of centrality? Or are there better non-trivial measure that predicts the productivity?

Suggested Data:

HEP-th dataset from KDD cup http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/kddcup/datasets.html Look at the abstract and citation graph sets

SNAP has other relevant datasets, you can also consider finding/scraping your own

You can consider applying other algorithms like community detection etc to see if you find any other interesting results.
